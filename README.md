# Win-C
#This repository stores the codes I wrote in my freshman C language class.At the beginning,I used VC6.0++ to write C program.Then I found some shrtcoming 
 in VC6.0++.To be honest ,VC6.0++ is a very quick and good C compiler.But it don't adapt to write struct and it always make some unuseful fileso that
 I was so puzzeled with it.Now I use VS code to write my programming language.The only draback of VS code is its configure.It's so complicated,until now I 
 also have a little puzzle.Now,I have learnt C、C++、java and python programming language.I can edit them in VS code.2020 is coming,In the next year,I will 
 become the best man in my heart and achieve my dream.
#The repository stores my past,including a lot of mistakes,and I will study hard in the next time.
